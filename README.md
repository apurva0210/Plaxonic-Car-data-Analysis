# Plaxonic-Car-data-Analysis

**Problem Statement for Plaxonic Car Data Analysis**

*Introduction*:

Plaxonic, a prominent player in the automotive industry, has accumulated a dataset containing information about various car attributes. They aim to leverage this data to build a regression model that can predict the price of cars based on specific features.

*Objective*:

The objective is to develop a robust regression model for predicting car prices. Plaxonic intends to utilize this model to assist customers and sellers in estimating fair prices for cars listed in their platform.

*Challenges*:

1. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identifying the most relevant attributes that significantly influence car prices.

2. **Data Quality**:
   - Ensuring the dataset is free from outliers, missing values, or any inconsistencies that could impact model accuracy.

3. **Model Accuracy**:
   - Striving to build a regression model that provides accurate price predictions for various car configurations.

*Requirements*:

The analysis should encompass the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Gaining insights into the relationships between individual features and car prices.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selecting, transforming, or creating new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choosing an appropriate regression algorithm based on the nature of the data and business requirements.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Utilizing a portion of the dataset to train the regression model and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R-squared).

6. **Model Validation and Fine-tuning**:
   - Validating the model on a separate test set and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

*Deliverables*:

Plaxonic expects the following:

1. **Regression Model**:
   - A well-trained regression model capable of predicting car prices accurately.

2. **Model Evaluation Report**:
   - Summarizing the performance metrics and demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

3. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Identifying the key features that have the most significant impact on car prices.

By executing this analysis, Plaxonic aims to provide a valuable tool for both customers and sellers in estimating fair market values for cars, ultimately enhancing the user experience on their platform.
